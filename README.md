# 🧠 AI-Powered Fashion Recommender System

This is an AI-powered fashion recommender system that uses **transfer learning** with a **pretrained ResNet50** model. Based on a given image, the system finds and recommends **visually similar fashion items** from the dataset.  

It works like an **image search**—upload an image, and it shows top 5 similar fashion products.
